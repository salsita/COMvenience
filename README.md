COMvenience
===========

COMvenience is a collection of templates and classes to make some things in COM a bit more convenient - just as the name suggests.

Currently there is:

*   *COMvenience.h*<br>
    Include this file if you don't want to include each single file.

*   *comvmacros.h*<br>
    Some helpful macros for COM/ATL

*   *comvptrs.h*<br>
    Some helpful `CComPtr<>` extensions.

*   *comvDispatchArgs.h*<br>
    `class DispatchArgs`<br>
    A `DISPPARAMS` wrapper.

*   *comvtypes.h*<br>
    Some helpful and often used types.

*   *comvbrowser.h*<br>
    `CCom(QI)Ptr` derivations for WebBrowser control related interfaces.
